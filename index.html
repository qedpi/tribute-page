            <h2>Let me count my thanks:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Born into humble backgrounds, they studied hard, aspiring for a better life</p>
            <p>They relocated twice, to different countries, in order to give me a brighter future</p>
            <p>They had to learn two new Languages, struggled to find employment, while taking care of me</p>
            <p>They endured long times apart, in order to keep the family together</p>
            <p>They are my greatest supporters, while being approachable like close friends</p>
            <p>They accept my flaws, support my attempts at betterment, and believe in me</p>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <p>I want them to know that I have not forgotten their sacrifices</p>
            <p>In time, and in turn, and in tune with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety">filial piety</a></p>
            <p>I will return this gift of a better life to them</p>
            <p>Thank you, for the gift of life, for the gift of love!</p>
